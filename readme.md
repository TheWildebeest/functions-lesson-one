# Functions Lesson One: Challenge

You've learned the basics, now it's time to put your newfound skills to the test!

### Prerequisites

You will need to have the following installed:
* VSCode
* Git
* Node (version 12 or above recommended)
* Code Runner extension

### Getting started

In your terminal, run

```
git clone https://github.com/TheWildebeest/functions-lesson-one.git
```

## Instructions

1. Look through files 01â€“03. Run the code, look at the output, and make sure you understand why the program is generating this output.

2. In file 04, _declare_ a nice, simple function that checks if someone is allowed to purchase alcohol based on;
  * their date of birth
  * today's date
  * the country they live in.

  The current version of the function is hard-coded to check if the person is under 18. See how much you can improve it.

3. Run your code code using the "Code Runner" VSCode extension by Jun Han. See if you can get the _function calls_ to return the correct output.
